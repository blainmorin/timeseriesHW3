We are going to perform the classical decomposition algorithm (CDA) upon a time series of monthly temperatures recorded in Columbus, OH from January 1995 to December 2005. The units of measurement is Fahrenheit.

```{r}

temp <-
  c(29.9, 28.1, 44.3, 50.6, 61.0, 72.4, 75.6, 76.9, 63.6, 55.7, 38.1, 29.2,
    27.9, 30.7, 34.4, 50.5, 60.6, 70.8, 73.9, 73.6, 65.8, 55.5, 37.3, 37.4,
    28.0, 35.9, 42.9, 47.9, 57.1, 70.0, 74.3, 70.4, 65.4, 55.3, 40.6, 35.4,
    37.0, 39.4, 42.9, 53.7, 67.2, 71.7, 74.9, 75.7, 71.5, 56.0, 46.0, 41.5,

## set up the time variable, 'year'
year <- seq(from=1995, by=1/12, length=length(temp))

## plot the time series.
plot(year, temp, type="l",
     xlab="year", ylab="monthly temperature (Fahrenheit)")
